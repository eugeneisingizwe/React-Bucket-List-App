# React-Bucket-List-App
## Description
In this project I am managing state using the "useState" Hook, pass data as props to child components, and use lists and keys to render a list of bucket-list items. 

## Installation

## User Story

Work with your group to resolve the following issues:

* As a user, I want to be able to able to enter a bucket-list item.

* As a user, I want to be able to set the eagerness level of a bucket-list item.

* As a user, I want to see a list of all my bucket-list items after they are added, with colors that identify their eagerness level.

* As a user, I want to be able to edit and delete bucket-list items.

## Acceptance Criteria

* It's done when I write logic to add a bucket-list item in `components/BucketList.js`.

* It's done when I write logic to mark a bucket-list item as complete or incomplete.

* It's done when I write logic that will remove a bucket-list item from the list.

* It's done when I write logic to update a bucket-list item in `components/Bucket.js`.

* It's done when I write logic to render a list of bucket-list items using `.map`.

* It's done when each bucket-list item has a color that corresponds to the priority or "eagerness" to complete.

* It's done when each bucket-list item renders a button to edit and delete the item.
